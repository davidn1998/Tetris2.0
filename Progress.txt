Our project is to make a clone of the classic game Tetris. We are making the clone in Java with the use of the newest version of JavaFX. Our game currently has a basic version of Tetris running that you can play without any major issue. We have not found any bugs yet and plan to add a 'Next Block' feature that shows you what block is coming next in the queue. We hope to make the boarder of the game look more pleasing to the eye then prepare the product for submission. If time allows we also hope to add other features to the game if time allows and we can think of any.
